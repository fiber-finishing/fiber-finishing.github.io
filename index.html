        <p>Sweater-piece blues getting you down? Too busy to put the finishing touches on your stuffies? Got a stash of granny squares and no clue what to do next? I would be happy to help you turn your pieces into the project you imagined when you first put yarn to needle (or hook).</p>

        <p>I’ve been knitting and crocheting for myself, my family, and friends for about the past 15 years. Fiber craft is a hobby I’m passionate about , and I love helping other people see their creative visions come to life.</p>

        <p>Let me help get you to the finish line!</p>
